## Version 2 


### Expectations

* Call your branch for this portion `v2.0.0`. You will submit by opening a PR
against the `main` branch.

1. The structure of your initial 3 page client report should remain the same
(and still be less than 3 pages).
1. You should adjust the client report in light of the, now complete,
statistical analysis.
1. **(NEW)** You should add a *Statistical Appendix* detailing your analysis.
The target audience is statisticians (you and your classmates). Describe your
analysis carefully using statistical language and undertaking any EDA,
diagnostics, model checks, that are necessary. Carefully describe issues with
data cleaning. If you do something Bayesian, describe how you know your MCMC
converged. Etc. The page limit for this component is 5 pages. Think of this
as a roadmap carefully describing what you did and why. If you needed to
return to this project in the future, this part tells you, more precisely,
what you did.


### Best practices

* Write in language that client can easily understand. Avoid technical 
details. Use examples and figures to explain or illustrate.
* Do not put computer code or output anywhere.
* Explain key concepts and ideas in easy-to-understand language. Do not refer 
the client to references for explanations before giving your own.
* The captions of graphs and tables should be self-contained enough so that the 
meaning is clear without reading the body of the report.
* Use 11 or 12 point sizes.
* The main text of the report should include only the most essential tables 
and figures. 
* Put additional tables and figures in Appendix.
* Title and authors: Choose a reasonable title. Don't call it "Sugary Beverages"
or "Homework 2". 
* You must open your PR by midnight on the due date.
